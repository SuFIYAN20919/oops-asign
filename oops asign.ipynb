    "\n",
    "1. **Flexibility and Extensibility**\n",
    "   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. This means you can write code that works with superclasses or interfaces, and it will automatically work with any subclass objects. This makes your code more flexible and easier to extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability**\n",
    "   Because polymorphism lets you use a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types), you can reuse the same code to work with different types of objects without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplifies Code Maintenance**\n",
    "   When you rely on polymorphism, adding new classes or changing behavior requires less change to existing code. You just add new subclasses or override methods without modifying the code that uses the base class or interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Supports Dynamic Method Binding (Late Binding)**\n",
    "   Polymorphism allows the program to decide at runtime which method implementation to call. This dynamic behavior is essential for designing systems that need to behave differently based on the actual object type, even when accessed through a common reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Improves Code Readability and Design**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Significance of `super()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access to Parent Class Methods**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Avoids Hardcoding**:\n",
    "   By using `super()`, you avoid hardcoding the parent class name, making the code more maintainable and robust in case of refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Supports Multiple Inheritance**:\n",
